This is the reflection file for Sprint 2.

For this sprint, we got different team memebers each worked on a specific field of
the game and put all the parts together after they are in good shapes. This kind of 
working style turned out to be efficient although there can be some drawbacks. One 
of the cons can be the unbalanced amount of the workload for each member, since each
area of the game content required diffrent amount of effort. Also, because each member
got to work on a specific field of the game by their own, these areas are pretty 
independent with each other and one member may be required to put in extra effort
in order to get some understanding about another field. This can cost time in the 
later projects when interactions are required between different systems of the game.

Also, we should remember to clean the solution before submitting to the repository
since we don't want to add unnecessary build files to the project. There were some 
project cache files that cannot be get rid of when pushing, but since they were not 
appeared to be harmful, there are no problem for keeping them.
