Sprint2 Reflection

This sprint is done as expected. 
Team members had conversations frequently. 
Each part of this sprint was written by different member independently.
I roughly went through other parts and they look good enough. 
Next time we probably want to have a standard on some trivias(naming, how to call a class method in main class, etc) before we start doing our stuffs.
