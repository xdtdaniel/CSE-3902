Sprint2 Reflection

This sprint mainly have 4 parts, Player, Enemy, Block, Item. Each teammate completes their own part independently,
and merge all parts together at the end. Overall this sprint performed well. Even everyone follow the same framework,
it still need more time for me to understand the code from other parts since everyone have it own coding style.
On next sprint, we might need to communicate more than sprint2, since there are lots of things need to interact with each other.
