This Sprint posed the challenge for me to create the entire audio section and implementation myself since I decided to take up the task as a challenge when we were splitting task. The Audio implementation also required a ton of tie-in between collision and item handling which initially I had difficulty implementing due to the fact that most are written in previous sprints by other teammates. However I believe our communication and collaboration was stronger and more efficeint than ever, so we were alble to implement most if not all the sound effects without much problem. I would like to thank all my teammates for helping me out on creating a big segement for the first time by myself and all in all it was a great sprint.
