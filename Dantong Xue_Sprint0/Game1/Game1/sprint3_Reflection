[BurnDown Chart]

[Reflection of Zhihan Li]
    This sprint is mainly about load file and handle the collision of each two objects. Both parts require a lot of interaction between each
    object part(player-block, player-enemy, player-item, enemy-block, collision detection-collision handler). Each teammate exchanged opinions with other 
    teammates alot. Everyone are pay attention on create meaningful variable and class name which is easy for other to understand(even there are still some 
    variable name is not clearly enough as instructor mentioned on code review lecture). Although the workload is still not that balanced based on this 
    sprint's requirement. Everyone in our team down their work correctly.
