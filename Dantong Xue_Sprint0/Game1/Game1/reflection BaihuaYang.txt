In Sprint 3, all my job was implementing the CollisionHandler classes. However, since those classes required several methods from different objects and we didn't have a consistent date requirement of completion, the implementation of CollisionHandlers was suspended several times. Hence, we probably need to make a more specific schedule for what stuffs have to be done before a date.
