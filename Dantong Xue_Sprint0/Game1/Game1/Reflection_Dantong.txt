In Sprint 4, we extended the structure that we already established in Sprint 3. It went smoothly as we planned ahead with clear dividing of work. The most challenging part for this Sprint was not writing functional codes but debugged the codes afterwards. Since the structure has been pretty big and different components all connected to each other, it was more difficult to debug compared to the previous sprints. Our collaboration with effective communication boosted the debug process quite a lot. I would like to thank all teammates for their help solving problems together when we had trouble.
