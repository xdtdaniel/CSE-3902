In this sprint I crreated a new weapon called Ice sword that has the ability to freeze enemy inplace for 50 frames(same amount as damage cooldown). This was implemented to make the last boss fight with the saw easier to handle due to its rapid movement. New sprites were created of link holding the ice swords and thanks to baihua yang for the basic implementation of attacks based on similar wooden and master swords. I feel collaboration is more important than ever for this sprint as the project gets much complicated. The somewhat lack of comments on code also made implementing the new weapon a bit challenging so I had to go back to the creator of player class for help.
