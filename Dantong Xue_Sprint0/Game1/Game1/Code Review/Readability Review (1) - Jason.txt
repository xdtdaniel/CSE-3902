Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 
I didn't notice anything unreadable in the code of this class. 
Field names and method names are all simple and make sense, and there is not 
much of specific logic and implementation covered in the Link class. Implementation
details are mainly covered in the state classes and sprite drawing classes, which is
just the way the state design pattern works.
