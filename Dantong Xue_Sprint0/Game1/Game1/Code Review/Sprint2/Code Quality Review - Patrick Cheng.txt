Specific comments on code quality:

This is a very simple class for loading all the textures of the blocks. All the code is very simple and straight forward. Though there are a lot of content in this class, but mostly it's just declaring the object name and loading the content and creating the block, the class will be easy to maintain. The class has low coupling and high cohesion.
 
Hyporhetical change:
The implementation of the class is very simple. If new content is needed in the future we only need to load the content and create the block. With the current implementation it's really easy to work with this.
