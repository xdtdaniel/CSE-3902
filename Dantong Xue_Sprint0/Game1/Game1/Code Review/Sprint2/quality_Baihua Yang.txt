Low coupling since only IProjectile object used. 
High cohesion since every field has its own functionality in implementations. 
Some duplicated code of IProjectile instances. 

Suggestions: 
Use state machine or state pattern for better maintainability and extensibility.
Implement a method to handle multiple IProjectile instances instead of calling the same method for every IProjectile instances.
