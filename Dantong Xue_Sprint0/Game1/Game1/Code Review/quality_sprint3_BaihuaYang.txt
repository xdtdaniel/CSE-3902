Low coupling since only fields of LoadAll.cs are used. 
High cohesion since every field has its own functionality in implementations, except some fields are not used in current class and 2 unnecessary assignments of value.

Suggestions: 
Review the code and remove those not used variables and unnecessary value assignments.
