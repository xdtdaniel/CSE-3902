Sprint number: 2
Reviewing Code: ItemFactory.cs
Code From: Zhihan Li

Specific comments on code quality: 
Everything follows the requirement of maintainablity.
All codes used Interfaces from IItemSprite. 
All the methods are short, and this class has low coupling.
This class is used sheerly as item factory, thus it has high cohesion.

Hyporhetical change: Adding new features are easy and may only require loading the content and adding one-line new method. This can be easily done with current implementation.
