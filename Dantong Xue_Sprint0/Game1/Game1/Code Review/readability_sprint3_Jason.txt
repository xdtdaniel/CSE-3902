Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 
This class is overall readable alathough it is lengthy.
A large part of the code is taken by the switch cases for
reading csv files. However, reading this file may require knowledge
about the csv file layout since some variable name is only going to
make sense if the reader knows about the basic strcture of the
read-in file.
