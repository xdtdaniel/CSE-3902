Specific comments on code quality: 
	Nothing violated the requirement of maintainablity, this class is easy to modify and extend. It has low coupling, since
  it only called by Game1.cs and  HUDPanel.cs, and it get number of heart from Dictionary type itemList. This class do not
  have high interdependency so it is easy to maintain and change. It also has high cohesion, it used to draw the number of
  heart on HUD and do not have any unrelated function.

A hypothetical change on this class is to use this class to draw another item on HUD, and it is easy to change.  If the new
item have multiple frame, we could  add  more if-else statement instead  draw, if  the  new item  is just one frame, we can
remove if-else statement, no  other change needed.
