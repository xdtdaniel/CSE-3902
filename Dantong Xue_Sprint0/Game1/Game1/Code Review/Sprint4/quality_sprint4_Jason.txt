Specific comments on code quality:

This class does not contain lot of fields and all the fields are private. There are not much of dependency from the outside
and the overall coupling should be loose. The class contains very little implementation details about how each part of the
HUD menu actually work so it has a high cohesion.

A hypothetical change and how to implement it:

We can add a functionality which let the player choose a room on the map in the HUD menu and teleport to the chosen room. 
This functionality requires changes in the HUD panel class and the relative player classes. For the HUD part, the new HUD
panel should allow room selection, and this can be implemented in the similar way of implementing the item selection mechanism.
