Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 
HUDPanel is the class which holds all the information of displaying and updating
the game HUD. It has a similar design compare to the PlayerPanel class although 
some of the functionalities are different. Variable names in the class are easy to 
understand and the code structure is clear to read, so the readability of this 
class is pretty good.
