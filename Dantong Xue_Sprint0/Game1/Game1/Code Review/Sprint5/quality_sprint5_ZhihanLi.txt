Specific comments on code quality: 
  Fan Shen add a new method freeze to Saw.cs, and my code review is for this new method.
  
	Nothing violated the requirement of maintainablity, this class is easy to modify and extend.This method do not
  have high interdependency so it is easy to maintain and change.

A hypothetical change on this class is to create a new method that pass the enemy list to it, and freeze certain enemy based on it index.
And this can reduce the coupling. But this code worked correctly, so it is not required to make this change.
