Specific comments on code quality: BladeBarrage.cs

One of the new features added in Sprint 5 is the player's ability of using special attacks. BladeBarrage.cs
is one of the class implementing the IPlayerAbility interface. There are many fields used in this class and
all of them are private. The interface provide methods for getting and setting the value of specific fields,
and this reduce the interdependenies and increase coupling. The class have high cohesion since methods in 
the class all serve for the one clear purpose of implementing the functionality of the skill.

A hypothetical change and how to implement it:

Since all the player abilities are attacking skills, we can maybe add a defensive skill to the player, which 
prevent the player from taking damage. We can implement the visual effect(update logic of sprite) with the 
help of the interface. The avoiding damage functionality can be implementged by adding a new player state.
