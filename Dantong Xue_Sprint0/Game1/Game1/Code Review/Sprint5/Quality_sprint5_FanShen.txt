Specific comments on code quality: 
  Zhihan Li added a new class for displaying exp on HUD under HUD class. The maintainability seems easy and has followed the same formula of other hud elements.

Hypothetical Change:
Consider adding functionality that supports scaling of exp for future items like 2x exp earning.
