Sprint number: 3

Name of the .cs file being reviewed: LoadEnemy.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Jason Lian
Number of minutes taken to complete the code review: 5 minutes

Specific comments on code quality: 
	Nothing violated the requirement of maintainablity, this class is easy to modify and extend.
	It has low coupling, since it only called by Game1.cs and  MouseEnemyController.cs. Which it is  easy to maintain and change.
	It also has high cohesion, it is only used to load enemy for  a room, and do not have any unrelated function.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
    LoadEnemy.cs is little bit longer than most of classes in our project, it might be more efficient to use the mapID from loadAll.cs instead to write the method seperately.
