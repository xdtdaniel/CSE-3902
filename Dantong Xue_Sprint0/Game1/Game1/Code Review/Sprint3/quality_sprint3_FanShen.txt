Specific comments on code quality: 
This class handles the detection and direction determining of rectangle collision in game. It utilized the detection of overlapping between 2 different rectangles and is essential 
to all other collision handling classes. The simple logic and straightforward implementation thus make it easy to maintain and change if needed in the future. 
The high cohesion ofthis class is due to its nature of only handlling collision detection and nothing else. The coupling is low as it only knows Player class.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
It could use a simpler if nest to make it more easy to understand
