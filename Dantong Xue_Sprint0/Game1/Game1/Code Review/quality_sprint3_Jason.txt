Specific comments on code quality:

This class does not contain lot of fields and all the fields are private. There are not much of dependency from the outside
and the overall coupling should be loose. The main method of the class is lengthy and performs more than one functions, but
there are not many methods in the class and other methods are very simple to read. So I think the cohesion of the class is high.

A hypothetical change and how to implement it:

It is possible for us to add a new type of block to the game. Using the implementation in LoadMap, we can just add a new checking
name for the new block in the switch cases and add new sprite of the new block.
