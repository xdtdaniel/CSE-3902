Specific comments on code quality:

Looking at the fields of the class, it only uses two objects from the other class so the overall coupling should be low.
Although, the class uses the PlayerItem concrete class instead of a interface for item and that may cause a tighter coupling.
In term of cohesion, methods of the class gnerally have small sizes since most of the implementation details are covered
in other classes. Since there is little implementation details, the class should have a high cohesion.
Variable names, field names and method names are all readable and the size of the class is small. Code should be easy to maintain.

A hypothetical change and how to implement it:

A possible feature to be added to the game is that we can have a new state which allow Link to not take any damage from enemies
or the environment for a limited amount of time. We can easily add a method in the Link.cs class which calls a state method which
handles this state. If the player character need to have different visual effect in this state, such as flashing or changing color,
we should use a decorator class to the Link.cs class.
