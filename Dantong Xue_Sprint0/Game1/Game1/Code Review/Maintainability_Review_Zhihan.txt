Specific comments on code quality: 
	Nothing violated the requirement of maintainablity, this class is easy to modify and extend.
	This class implement IBlock interface, and it only have 3 method instead so it is easy to be modified.
	It has low coupling, since this class is short enough  and it only called by BlockFactory class.
	It also has high cohesion, it is only used  to display a Block, and do not have any unrelated function.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
	This method only have 3 methods, and it is easy to be changed. The possible change in NonMovingNonAnimatedBlock.cs is player might use bomb to destory
	the block, we might need to change the UpdateBlock() method with some parameters.To do that, we need to update IBlock() method to have the required parameter.
