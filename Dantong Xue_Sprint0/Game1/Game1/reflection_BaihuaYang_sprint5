  
Reflection for Sprint 5

In this Sprint, I had added 3 new kinds of features into the game: achievement system, new actions and ability tree system for Link. Achievements were easy to implement but since the game was not big enough so there was only a few meaningful achievements could be added. I had difficulties in implementing jump and dash actions for Link. It was hard to identify a block and a wall since they were all named "block" at beginning. So finally I decided to make Link unable to jump over any block but only invincible when jumping. For ability tree, I was planning to implement a more complicated and variant version than it looks now. However, I didn't have enough time so I simplify it to be two single trending trees with 4 abilities for each one. By the way, it was really fun to create some pixel arts for the ability system. In addition, I also re wrote some implementation of what I did in previous sprints, since some of them did not have enough maintainability and flexibility. Despite I don't think this game will have any further development, it was a great experience to get familiar with game developments. During this sprint, I realized I had to manage and balance my time and workload, and saw the importance of following the practices of developing software.
